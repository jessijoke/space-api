## Air & Space Museum BACKEND

Air & Space Museum is a public museum webpage that allows users to get tickets for the museum attractions, and learn more about the museum. This is a Rails API backend that uses CORS to connect to connect the javascript frontend to the backend.
This is the backend only. The project requires the frontend, and the puzzle game. Repo links included. [Frontend](https://github.com/jessijoke/space-api) | [Puzzle Game](https://github.com/jessijoke/spacePuzzle)
